I was brought in to help the founders realize their product concept, a Mint.com-like financial manager, exclusively for real estate professionals. They explained that realtors have a difficult time managing their finances because of the scattered nature of their business, and they proposed a solution that would centralize all of a realtorâ€™s bank accounts and credit cards, and automatically categorize the transactions. At the end of the year the realtor could hit print and generate a detailed P&L for their accountant. A challenge was that realtors tend to have limited technology skills, so the solution needed to be drop dead simple and as automated as possible.

The founders are the senior agents at a large agency and had a team of 100 agents available for user research, as well as access to many more outside the agency at conferences. Through agent interviews and observation I identified four primary personas across the two dimensions of low to high technical and financial knowledge, and created user workflows for primary tasks and goals. I created the information architecture, then did numerous sketches and wireframes, defining about 75% of the first release, and built working prototypes with a development team. We completed several iterations of design, prototyping, usability testing, and development over several 2-3 week sprints, always focusing on the primary tasks and refining based on user feedback. The service was launched with immediate success.
